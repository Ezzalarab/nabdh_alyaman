# Child Safety & CSAE Standards — Nabdh Alyaman

**Applies to:** The Nabdh Alyaman mobile app and any related services.

## 1) Zero-tolerance for CSAE/CSAM

Nabdh Alyaman prohibits any content or behavior that exploits, abuses, sexualizes, grooms, or endangers children (minors under 18). We do not allow the creation, storage, sharing, or linking to **child sexual abuse material (CSAM)** in any form. Violations result in immediate removal and account actions. We will act in line with these standards and applicable laws. ([Google Help][2])

## 2) App purpose & eligibility

Nabdh Alyaman exists to help people **connect with voluntary blood donors** in Yemen. It is **not** a dating or social networking service and **not** a medical provider. Users must be **18+**. Profiles or content by/featuring minors are not permitted.

## 3) Prohibited content & conduct (partial list)

* Any sexual content involving minors; sexual solicitation; grooming; “sextortion”; trafficking; or attempts to contact minors. ([Google Help][2])
* Sharing a minor’s personal data or images; doxxing; harassment; hateful or violent threats.
* Misuse of donor contact data (spam, advertising, or any non-donation purpose).
* Uploading images or links that depict or imply sexualized minors, including AI-generated content. ([Google Help][2])

## 4) Moderation & enforcement

* We review user submissions (e.g., donor listings, messages, images/links where enabled).
* When we get **actual knowledge** of CSAM or CSAE, we **remove** it, **preserve necessary records**, and **report** according to Section 6 below. ([Google Help][1])
* We may suspend or ban accounts, restrict features, or contact authorities as required.

## 5) In-app reporting / feedback

You can report concerns **inside the app** via: **Settings → Report a Safety Issue** (or by emailing the Safety Contact below). Reports are reviewed with priority. Google Play requires an in-app way for users to reach us without leaving the app; this page documents that mechanism. ([Google Help][1])

## 6) Reporting to authorities

Confirmed CSAM is reported **to the appropriate authority** (for example, **NCMEC/CyberTipline** where applicable, or a **relevant regional authority**), consistent with law. We also cooperate with lawful requests from authorities. ([Google Help][2])

## 7) Prevention steps we take

* **Age gate:** Users confirm they are **18+**; profiles that appear to involve minors are removed.
* **Content filters & review:** We use a mix of automated checks and human review for reports; repeat violators are banned.
* **Limited data exposure:** Donor data is shown with purpose limits (blood donation only); scraping and resale are prohibited.
* **Education:** We remind users never to request images, money, or unrelated favors from donors.

## 8) How to report to us

* **In-app:** Settings → Report a Safety Issue
* **Email (designated CSAE contact):** **\[replace-with-your-safety-email]**
  Provide links, screenshots, and the approximate time of the incident.
